# Raspi_Poker_Player
This package includes MATLAB scripts that help you design a poker player using MATLAB, Deep Learning, and Raspberry Pi. 
The poker-playing algorithm consists of a deep learning network that predicts the cards, and a custom MATLAB algorithm that
identifies ranked hands from the predictions and then makes bets like an actual player would. The algorithm can finally be 
deployed to a Raspberry Pi hardware.
